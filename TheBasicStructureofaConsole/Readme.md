## What is C#

C# as mension earlier is one of the languages you can use to create application that will run on the .NET CLR.It is an evolution of c++ and c programming languages and has been create by microsoft specifically to work with the .NET platform .The c# language has been desined to incoporate many of the best features from other languages while cleaning up their problems.

Developing applications using C# is simpler than using C++, because the language syntax is simpler. Still, C# is a powerful language, and there is little you mightwant to do in C++ that you can't do in C#. Having said that, those features of C#that parallel the more advanced features of C++, such as directly accessing and manipulating system memory.

***C# is just one of the languages available for .NET development, but it is certainly the best.*** It has the advantage of being the only language designed from the ground up for the .NET Framework and is the principal language used in versions of .NET that are ported to other operating systems. To keep languages such as the .NET version of Visual Basic as similar as possible to their predecessors yet compliant with the CLR, certain features of the .NET code library are not fully supported, or at least require unusual syntax.

Applications You Can Write with C#
----------------------------------
The .Net framework has no Restrictions on the type of applications that are possible.

**Desktop applications** — Applications, such as Microsoft Office, that have a
familiar Windows look and feel about them. This is made simple by using the
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) module of the .NET Framework,
which is a library of controls (such as buttons, toolbars, menus, and so on) that
you can use to build a Windows user interface (UI).

**Windows Store applications** — Windows 8 introduced a new type of
application, known as a Windows Store application. This type of application is
designed primarily for touch devices, and it is usually run full-screen, with a
minimum of clutter, and an emphasis on simplicity. You can create these
applications in several ways, including using WPF.


**Cloud/Web applications** — The .NET Framework includes a powerful
system named ASP.NET, for generating web content dynamically, enabling
personalization, security, and much more. Additionally, these applications can
be hosted and accessed in the Cloud, for example on the Microsoft Azure
platform.

**Web APIs** — An ideal framework for building RESTful HTTP services that
support a broad variety of clients, including mobile devices and browsers.
WCF services — A way to create versatile distributed applications. Using
WCF you can exchange virtually any data over local networks or the Internet,
using the same simple syntax regardless of the language used to create a
service or the system on which it resides.

**Mobile application**- Xamarin framework which uses mono and dotnet to target all the available mobile application by building native application for android , ios and uwp. Using Xamarin form you can also be able to build a cross platform application using the same ui patterns and sharing the application code logic.
