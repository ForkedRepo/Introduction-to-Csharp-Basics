> # Operator Precendece
The `precedence and associativity` of C# operators affect the `grouping and evaluation` of operands in expressions. An `operator's precedence` is meaningful only if other operators with `higher or lower` `precedence` are `present`. Expressions with higher-precedence operators are evaluated `first`. Precedence can also be described by the word "binding." Operators with a higher precedence are said to have tighter binding.

The following table summarizes the `precedence and associativity` (the order in which the operands are evaluated) of C# operators, `listing them in order of precedence from highest to lowest`. Where `several operators appear together, they have equal precedence` and are evaluated according to their `associativity`. The operators in the table are described in the sections beginning with `Postfix Operators.` The rest of this section gives general information about `precedence and associativity`.

<li>Operators are listed in descending order of precedence. If several operators appear on the same line or in a group, they have equal precedence.<li/>
<li>All simple and compound-assignment operators have equal precedence.<li/>

An expression can contain several operators with `equal precedence`. When several such operators appear at the `same level in an expression`, evaluation proceeds according to the `associativity`of the operator, either from `right to left or from left to right`.
